            <h3>My Thoughts on the Tesla Model 3 After a Quick Test Drive</h3>

            <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my new blog and I would like to start off with this quick overview of a quick test drive of a Tesla Model 3 from earlier this year. To be clear, this test drive took place in February before the COVID-19 outbreak expanded here in the United States. Since I am from the Detroit metro area, I went to Tesla’s website to schedule a test drive at a Tesla gallery located in a nearby upscale mall. The process was very simple and then I was looking forward to trying out a pure electric car for the first time. On the day of the test drive, I went to the Tesla gallery and checked in with a representative. After waiting for a bit, a specialist showed up with the “key” card for a Model 3. Then we went out to the parking garage where Tesla kept their test drive vehicles. I ended up driving the gray Model 3 Long Range dual motor all-wheel drive variant shown in the photo above. This specific vehicle was equipped with the optional 19-inch wheels and the “full self-driving” package that included features such as “navigate on autopilot”, “smart summon”, and more. After the specialist showed me how to adjust the seat, steering wheel, and mirrors, I had about 30 minutes to drive the vehicle around. The first thing I noticed when setting off was how quiet the Model 3 was due to the absence of an internal combustion engine. Eventually I drove to the main road and I noticed that acceleration was effortless due to the instant torque of the electric motors. The specific Model 3 I drove had a 0-60 time of about 4.4 seconds which was close to many performance gas-powered cars on the market. As soon as there was an open section of road, I was able to try a full throttle acceleration. What followed was nothing that I had ever experienced before. The car was extremely quick, and it was very easy to get to high speeds. After trying out the acceleration, I decided to try out autopilot driver assist feature. I thought it was very natural and you had to keep your hands on the steering wheel, or the car would give a warning after a certain amount of time. In autopilot mode, the car kept a reasonable following distance from the car in front and kept track of the lane markers to ensure that the vehicle stays centered. Whenever the vehicle in front would slow down or come to a complete stop, the Model 3 will also slow down smoothly. After a few turns and driving on a few different roads, I had to drive back to the mall before my time was up. Upon returning, all I had to do was park the vehicle in one of the designated spots for Tesla vehicles on-site and head back to the Tesla gallery. I had a follow up discussion with the Tesla specialist and returned the key to the vehicle. Overall, I have to say that the process of the test drive was very simple, and the experience was worthwhile. As for the Model 3, I thought it was a great car with sophisticated technology but I am not sure if I would be ready to drive an electric car on a daily basis.</p>
