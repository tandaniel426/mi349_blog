            <p class="text">Due to the current situation of the pandemic, I thought about how I have not been going out as much as I used to. With everything going on right now, I definitely miss traveling with my family or even being able to go out without any worries. The idea hit me that I should make a post about one of my favorite places for a vacation, California. About three years ago in the summer of 2017 right after I graduated from high school, I went on a trip to California with the primary destinations consisting of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. I have already been to California prior, but I usually only went to either Los Angeles or San Francisco without an actual road trip between the different cities. This time we flew to Los Angeles first, drove to San Diego, went back up north to Los Angeles for a night, and then drove all the way up to San Francisco.</p>
            <p class="text">Starting with Los Angeles, I was definitely familiar with the area since I have a family member living in the area. Parts of Los Angeles that were noteworthy would be the diversity of food, the coastline and beaches, and the weather. Regarding cuisine, Los Angeles has choices such as Chinese food, Mexican food, and even Persian food. Overall, Los Angeles had a great selection of food in different parts of the metro area. Up next, San Diego was also a great city to visit with great restaurants in the Gaslamp Corridor. The beaches in San Diego were really nice and Coronado Island was a highlight as well. </p>
            <p class="text">Southern California’s cities were great and all, but the best part of Southern California was the Malibu coastline on the Pacific Coast Highway. Of course, anyone could just take the interstate up to San Francisco from Southern California, but the best way is to take the Pacific Coast Highway. Even though we did not drive the whole stretch on the Pacific Coast Highway due to a road closure at the time, we had a good glimpse of the breathtaking scenery of the Pacific Ocean on the California coast. We even had to opportunity to have stop in Santa Barbara which was a really nice city along the Pacific Coast Highway.</p>
            <p class="text">After a long drive we reached Carmel-by-the-Sea which is shown in the photo above with me at the beach around dusk. Carmel was a small coastal community that had plenty of small shops and places to eat. Finally, we ended up going to the San Francisco Bay Area. At the time, I had already chosen to study Computer Science for my undergraduate degree here at Michigan State. As a result, I was looking forward to seeing Silicon Valley where Google, Apple, and even Stanford University were located at. We spent a few days in the San Francisco Bay Area going through downtown, Pier 39, Japantown, Chinatown, and more. There was definitely a lot of things to do in the San Francisco Bay Area and I can definitely say that the highlight of that specific California trip was going up to a nearby hill to see the view of the Golden Gate Bridge.</p> 
            <p class="text">It was kind of sad having to go back to Michigan after an amazing trip to the three major cities of California, but I can definitely recommend California as a place to visit to anyone. Looking back, I can say that those were definitely different times compared to where we are now. My main hope is that soon we will be able to go back to our normal lives and enjoy the moments we have.</p>

            <h2>My Thoughts on the Tesla Model 3 After a Quick Test Drive</h2>

            <img src="teslaModel3.jpeg" alt="Tesla Model 3 Before My Test Drive" width="665" height="500">
            <p class="text">Hello everyone, welcome to my new blog and I would like to start off with this quick overview of a quick test drive of a Tesla Model 3 from earlier this year. To be clear, this test drive took place in February before the COVID-19 outbreak expanded here in the United States. Since I am from the Detroit metro area, I went to Tesla’s website to schedule a test drive at a Tesla gallery located in a nearby upscale mall. The process was very simple and then I was looking forward to trying out a pure electric car for the first time. </p>
            <p class="text">On the day of the test drive, I went to the Tesla gallery and checked in with a representative. After waiting for a bit, a specialist showed up with the “key” card for a Model 3. Then we went out to the parking garage where Tesla kept their test drive vehicles. I ended up driving the gray Model 3 Long Range dual motor all-wheel drive variant shown in the photo above. This specific vehicle was equipped with the optional 19-inch wheels and the “full self-driving” package that included features such as “navigate on autopilot”, “smart summon”, and more.</p>
            <p class="text">After the specialist showed me how to adjust the seat, steering wheel, and mirrors, I had about 30 minutes to drive the vehicle around. The first thing I noticed when setting off was how quiet the Model 3 was due to the absence of an internal combustion engine. Eventually I drove to the main road and I noticed that acceleration was effortless due to the instant torque of the electric motors. The specific Model 3 I drove had a 0-60 time of about 4.4 seconds which was close to many performance gas-powered cars on the market. As soon as there was an open section of road, I was able to try a full throttle acceleration. What followed was nothing that I had ever experienced before. The car was extremely quick, and it was very easy to get to high speeds.</p>
            <p class="text">After trying out the acceleration, I decided to try out autopilot driver assist feature. I thought it was very natural and you had to keep your hands on the steering wheel, or the car would give a warning after a certain amount of time. In autopilot mode, the car kept a reasonable following distance from the car in front and kept track of the lane markers to ensure that the vehicle stays centered. Whenever the vehicle in front would slow down or come to a complete stop, the Model 3 will also slow down smoothly.</p>
            <p class="text">After a few turns and driving on a few different roads, I had to drive back to the mall before my time was up. Upon returning, all I had to do was park the vehicle in one of the designated spots for Tesla vehicles on-site and head back to the Tesla gallery. I had a follow up discussion with the Tesla specialist and returned the key to the vehicle. Overall, I have to say that the process of the test drive was very simple, and the experience was worthwhile. As for the Model 3, I thought it was a great car with sophisticated technology but I am not sure if I would be ready to drive an electric car on a daily basis.</p>
