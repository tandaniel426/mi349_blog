    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Tan and I am currently a fourth-year 
    senior at Michigan State University with a major in Computer Science 
    and a minor in Information Technology. This is my blog that will mostly revolve around
    topics such as cars, travel, and technology. These three topics are actually my three greatest interests.</p>
    <p>Ever since I have been young, I have always had an interest in anything related to cars, travel, and tech. For cars, I am quite knowledgeable of many different types of cars. For travel, my family and I have been to many places within the US and abroad. I always like seeing new cities and having great food when I travel. Lastly, tech is the interest I got into when the iPhones were starting to get popular. Since then, I have always been interested to see the latest smartphones, computers, and other gadgets that are on the market. 
    <p>My goal with this blog is that people can learn from my experiences and possibly gain knowledge to apply to any of their own personal interests. I hope everyone will enjoy reading my posts and thank you for visiting my blog.</p>
